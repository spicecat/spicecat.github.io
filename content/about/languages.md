Programming languages that I know:

## A lot
- Python: great for everything except CP
- JavaScript: best for web dev; many interesting syntax features
- Java: too verbose
- HTML: just a markup language; just use React and MUI elements

## Some
- C++: best for cp; basically required for USACO gold now
- Spanish: from AP Spanish
