Hi! I'm Andy, a CS main and tryhard F2P gamer.

Here are some useless facts about me that you definitely didn't know before reading this:

- I have the book *Free Software, Free Society* (first edition) autographed by the infamous Richard Stallman himself.

- I love [breaking Arch Linux machines](/posts/installing-every-arch-package/) and hate running my [Arch Linux server](https://exozy.me).

- I'm currently exploring federated and decentralized systems and developing ActivityPub federation for [Gitea](https://gitea.com/Ta180m/gitea).

- [Games I play](games)

- [Languages I know](languages)

And if you reading this, that means that special patterns in my biological neural networks transcribed into UTF-8 encoded strings contained within Markdown documents converted into HTML and CSS by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Gokarna theme](https://github.com/526avijitgupta/gokarna) deployed to [exozyme](https://exozy.me) using [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org) transmitted to your machine over HTTP and rendered and displayed on your screen have now created special patterns in your biological neural networks. Awesome, telepathy!
