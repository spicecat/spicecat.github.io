Hi! I'm Anthony Wang, some random math and CS enthusiast from St. Louis, Misery (er, I meant Missouri).

Here are some useless facts about me that you definitely didn't know before reading this:

- I've had [five](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c726379) [blogs](https://git.exozy.me/Ta180m/blog) and six email addresses over the past few years. I wasted a few hours copying every blog post I ever wrote to this website, but the older posts use BBCode and I was too tired to convert them to Markdown.

- I have the book *Free Software, Free Society* (first edition) autographed by the infamous Richard Stallman himself.

- I love [breaking Arch Linux machines](/posts/installing-every-arch-package/) and hate running my [Arch Linux server](https://exozy.me).

- I enjoy violating the [Discord](/posts/dont-use-discord/) TOS every day.

- Obviously, some people abhor my writing style.

- I'm currently exploring federated and decentralized systems and developing ActivityPub federation for [Gitea](https://gitea.com/Ta180m/gitea).

- I'm sleeping right now with 1/3 probability.

- I wasted an hour messing with the MIT Kerberos registration website to get around the frontend's limitation of 3 character usernames, and registered the aesthetically perfect username of `xy`.

If you'd like to waste your time too, here are some more black holes to get sucked into.

- [Games I like](games)

- [Languages I know](languages)

And if you reading this, that means that special patterns in my biological neural networks transcribed into UTF-8 encoded strings contained within Markdown documents converted into HTML and CSS by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Gokarna theme](https://github.com/526avijitgupta/gokarna) deployed to [exozyme](https://exozy.me) using [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org) transmitted to your machine over HTTP and rendered and displayed on your screen have now created special patterns in your biological neural networks. Awesome, telepathy!
