A dodecahedron folded out of a single sheet of paper! I loved exploring the geometry behind folding those 108-degree angles.

A nice dodecahedron that I made with Blender. Used as my profile picture everywhere.

Here's an animated version that only took a few hours to render with 24 CPU threads on full throttle...

My own Lego dodecahedron design, completely different than the other Lego dodecahedra you can find online. I still have no idea how I discovered the clever design which only uses 120x 2x2 bricks and 60x black pins? That's it! You can do some pretty cool things with even the most basic pieces! Just a warning: building this thing is an absolute nightmare, so if you think building Legos is easy, try making this.
