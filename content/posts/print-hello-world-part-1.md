There are a few reasons why the vast majority of competitive programmers use C++: it has a decent standard library, several good reference sources, and lots of tutorials online. But these factors are not unique to C++; what matters is its speed. A few milliseconds could be the difference between and accepted solution and time limit exceeded. Anyways, here's the code, about two weeks late, written in the "conventional" C++ style, as opposed to the condensed, macro-abusing style of competitive programmers.

| Factor | Rating | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed | 3 | Very fast after compilation, nearly as fast as C, and faster than a lot of programming languages even counting compilation |
| Documentation | 3 | Not that I used any when writing this program, but there a lot of good resources out there, such as [cplusplus.com](www.cplusplus.com) |
| General | 3 | C++ has its flaws, but for some applications such as competitive programming, it's unbeatable |


Be on the lookout for Part 2, Python! No guarantees about the date, but it should show up in a few days, once I get some time.
