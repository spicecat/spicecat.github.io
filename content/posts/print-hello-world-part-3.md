Java -- gives me AP Computer Science memories (although I think they'll switch to Python soon) -- the epitome of object-oriented programming. Not saying that OOP is bad -- it has its uses, such as with GUI toolkits -- but also [drawbacks](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Dijkstra-say-that-%E2%80%9CObject-oriented-programming-is-an-exceptionally-bad-idea-which-could-only-have-originated-in-California-%E2%80%9D?share=1). I just don't appreciate how it tries to force OOP upon me whenever I use it.

| Factor | Rating | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed | 3 | Quite fast after compiling to bytecode |
| Documentation | 3 | I really want to give Java a 2 due to personal bad experiences, but there are lots of good resources out there |
| General | 2 | Yes! I can finally give Java a 2 |


I'm giving myself a two-day deadline for Part 4, C.
