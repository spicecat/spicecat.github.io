I think we can all agree that Python is a wonderful first language to learn, with easy, clean syntax, making it easy to learn, write, and read. (The last one is very important: code is usually written once, but read many times) But is it a great last language? Its huge abundance of modules and libraries for Python makes it really easy to cool programs that would take thousands of lines of code in other languages. You really can do anything with Python! But it won't be fast: when you need speed, Python simply can't compete.

| Factor | Rating | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed | 2 | One of Python's main drawbacks, PyPy is better but has its own flaw |
| Documentation | 3 | [docs.python.org](docs.python.org) is pretty good, there are also tons of other resources |
| General | 3 | Overall very good for a wide variety of applications, with only a few flaws |


I should be able to find some time to write up Part 3, Java, by next week.
